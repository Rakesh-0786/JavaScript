<!-- what is the difference between http and https?
ChatGPT
The main difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS provides secure communication over the network by encrypting the data exchanged between the client and server, while HTTP does not offer such encryption. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of the two:

1. Overview
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):

A protocol used for transferring hypertext (web pages) over the internet. It operates over TCP/IP and is designed for communication between web browsers and web servers.
Port: Uses port 80 by default.
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):

An extension of HTTP that incorporates encryption for secure communication over the internet. It combines HTTP with SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security).
Port: Uses port 443 by default. -->
